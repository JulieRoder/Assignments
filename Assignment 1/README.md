Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP1804, IT@JCU

By: Julie-Anne Roder

    How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?

    All up it took me about 18 hrs spread over a couple of days. Started with mapping program out, creating the flowchart, then started coding.
    After I had finshed coding, I spent a day away from it before looking at it again to check for errors or if any adjustments needed to be made.

    What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

    I would use the same process, with any adjustments made based on the feedback from this assignment.
